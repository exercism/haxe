# About

Haxe is an open source high-level, strongly-types, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code, for many different computing platforms from one code-base.

There are several supported target languages which allow for different use-cases: [Supported Target Languages][supported-target-languages]

[Types][types] introduces the seven different kinds of types in Haxe and how they interact with each other. The discussion of types is continued in [Type System][type-system], where features like unification, type parameters and type inference are explained.

[Class Fields][class-fields] is all about the structure of Haxe classes and, among other topics, deals with properties, inline fields and generic functions.

In [Expressions][expressions] we see how to actually get programs to do something by using expressions.

[Language Features][language-features] concludes the Haxe language reference by describing some features in detail such as pattern matching, string interpolation and dead code elimination.
