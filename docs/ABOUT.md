# About

Haxe is an open source high-level, strongly-types, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code, for many different computing platforms from one code-base.

Currently, there are nine supported target languages which allow for different use-cases:

| Name        | Main usages                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| JavaScript  | Browser, Desktop, Mobile, Server       |
| Neko        | Desktop, Server, CLI                   |
| HashLink    | Desktop, Mobile, Game consoles         |
| PHP         | Server                                 |
| Python      | Desktop, Server                        |
| Lua         | Desktop, Scripting                     |
| C++         | Desktop, Mobile, Server, Game consoles |
| Flash       | Desktop, Mobile                        |
| Java        | Desktop, Mobile, Server                |
| JVM         | Desktop, Mobile, Server                |
| C#          | Desktop, Mobile, Server                |

[Types][types] introduces the seven different kinds of types in Haxe and how they interact with each other. The discussion of types is continued in [Type System][type-system], where features like unification, type parameters and type inference are explained.

[Class Fields][class-fields] is all about the structure of Haxe classes and, among other topics, deals with properties, inline fields and generic functions.

In [Expressions][expressions] we see how to actually get programs to do something by using expressions.

[Language Features][language-features] concludes the Haxe language reference by describing some features in detail such as pattern matching, string interpolation and dead code elimination.
