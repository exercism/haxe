# Introduction

A [`Date`][date] object in Haxe is and object that contains both _date_ and _time_. Its value cannot be mutated once the constructor has been called.

The default format of the `Date` object is: `DAY MONTH day year hours:minutes:seconds timezone`. For example `Sat Jan 1 2022 10:30:43 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)`.
