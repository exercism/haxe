## Track linting

[`configlet`](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet) is an Exercism-wide tool for working with tracks. You can download it by running:

```shell
./bin/fetch-configlet
```

Run its [`lint` command](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet/lint) to verify if all exercises have all the necessary files and if config files are correct:

```shell
$ ./bin/configlet lint

The lint command is under development.
Please re-run this command regularly to see if your track passes the latest linting rules.

    language, slug, active, blurb, version, status, online_editor, key_features, tags

### Haxe icon
The Haxe logo is assumed to be owned by the Haxe Foundation, but this is not made explicit. We have adapted it, changing the colours, for use on Exercism, which we believe to fall under fair use.
