The tests for this exercise rely on the third-party `datetime` library instead of the `Date` class from the standard library. In our testing, the standard Date class did not support [daylight savings time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) which led to issues with multiple test cases. Please review [the official documentation](https://lib.haxe.org/p/datetime/) for the `datetime` library for any questions.
